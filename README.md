üìñ Twitch Chat CSV to PDF
Easily convert your exported Twitch chat logs (CSV format) into a neatly formatted PDF ‚Äî all with one click!
Perfect for archiving, sharing, or just reliving your favourite moments.

## Why do you need this program?

If you‚Äôve ever tried reading Twitch chat logs directly from a CSV file, you know it‚Äôs a mess. Long lines, confusing columns, and no easy way to find specific dates or messages. This program solves that by turning those raw CSV chat logs into clean, easy-to-read PDFs:

- No more messy spreadsheets: Chat messages are neatly organized by date with clickable links for quick navigation.
- Readable timestamps: All times are converted to local time of your choice so you know exactly when things happened.
- ~Looks professional: Each PDF includes the streamer‚Äôs logo on the first page to make your archives look polished.~
- Easy to share and archive: PDFs are simple to open, search, and save, unlike bulky CSVs.
- This tool runs locally/offline, no data is sent or stored.
- No account or login required.

In short, this tool makes Twitch chat logs easy to read, understand, and keep, no spreadsheet skills required.

## Step 2 (Alternative) ‚Äî Run the Python Script Yourself
If you don‚Äôt want to run the EXE file, or if you want to see how the code works, you can run the Python script directly. This is great for users who want full control or are new to Python ‚Äî we‚Äôll walk you through the setup.

1. Install Python (which includes pip)
- Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
Click the Download Python 3.x.x button (choose the latest version 3.8 or above).
Run the installer. Important: During installation, check the box that says ‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù before clicking Install.
Wait for the installation to finish.

2. Open Command Prompt
- Press Windows Key + R
- Type cmd and press Enter
A black terminal window will open ‚Äî this is where you will type commands.

3. In the Command Prompt, type:

```bash
python --version
```
You should see something like:
Python 3.x.x

Next, check pip (Python‚Äôs package installer) by typing:
```bash
pip --version
```
You should see something like:
pip x.x.x from ...

If you get an error, try typing:
```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```
Then try pip --version again.

4. Install required packages
- Now, run this command in Command Prompt to install all necessary Python libraries used by the script:
```bash
pip install pandas fpdf2 Pillow requests python-dotenv pytz
```
Wait for it to finish. It downloads and installs everything the script needs.

5. Prepare your files
- Put the Twitch CSV chat export file (chat_messages.csv) and the Python script (Download TwitchChatExportPDF.py from this page) into the same folder on your PC.

6. Run the Python script
- In Command Prompt, navigate to the folder where your files are saved. For example, if your files are in C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\TwitchChat, type:
```bash
cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\TwitchChat
```
- Then run the script by typing:
```bash
python TwitchChatExportPDF.py
```
7. View your PDFs
- After it finishes, a new folder named Twitch Chat History will appear in that folder, containing your readable PDF files! Enjoy looking back at your early days of Twitch messages.
